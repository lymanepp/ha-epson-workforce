## Installation

### Via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/)
<a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=lymanepp&repository=ha-epson-workforce&category=integration" target="_blank"><img src="https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg" alt="Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store." /></a>

### Manually

Get the folder `custom_components/epson_workforce` in your HA `config/custom_components`

## Configuration
<a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=epson_workforce" target="_blank"><img src="https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg" alt="Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration." /></a>

- Enter your printer's IP address and optionally adjust the status page path.

> [!TIP]
> **Finding Your Printer's IP Address:**
> * Check your router's admin panel for connected devices
> * Use your printer's display panel (Network Settings â†’ TCP/IP)
> * Check the Epson printer software on your computer

## Sensor Naming

Sensors are automatically created for each available ink cartridge and printer status. They are named in the format `Ink level {Color}` for cartridges and `Printer Status` for the overall printer state.

The integration automatically detects and creates sensors for:

- **Ink Levels**: Black, Photo Black, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Light Cyan, Light Magenta
- **Maintenance**: Cleaning cartridge level
- **Status**: Overall printer status

> [!NOTE]
> Only sensors available on your specific printer model will be created. The integration queries your printer and only adds sensors for cartridges that are detected.

Example sensor names:
- `sensor.ink_level_black_192_168_1_100`
- `sensor.ink_level_cyan_192_168_1_100`
- `sensor.printer_status_192_168_1_100`

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot your Home Assistant instance, you can add the following configuration to your configuration.yaml file:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning  # Default log level for all components
  logs:
    custom_components.epson_workforce: debug    # Enable debug logging for this integration
```

> [!WARNING]
> **Common Issues:**
> * Ensure the printer is powered on and connected to your network
> * Verify the printer IP address is correct
> * Try accessing `http://YOUR_PRINTER_IP/PRESENTATION/HTML/TOP/PRTINFO.HTML` directly in your browser
> * Check Home Assistant logs for any error messages
> * Some cartridge types may not be available on all printer models
